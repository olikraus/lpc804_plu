/*

  Description:
    Write the content of one page (64 bytes) to target location
    Executes erase and write operation.
    On a LPC804 with 15MHz, this call requires about 3ms.
    The LPC804 probably required 3ms (most subsystems active)
    --> cap time constant = 3.3V/3ms * 5uF = 5ms

  Arguments:
    dest_flash_adr:		Destination address, 64 byte boundary, 0x0000-0x7F7F
    src_ram_adr:		Source location of the page, word boundary

  Return:
    0, in case of any error
