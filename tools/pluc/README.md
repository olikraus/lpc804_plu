# PLUC

"pluc" is a synthesis compiler for the LPC804 PLU subsystem.

## Installation

"pluc" is a plain "C" commandline executable. Although there is makefile, only
```
gcc *.c -o pluc
```
is required to compile all the source code. The generated exe can be copied to any place.
Under Windows OS the source can be compiled within "MinGW".
