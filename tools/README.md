## tools

### hex2lpc8xx

A small and reliable ISP upload tool for the LPC804. Linux only. Can execute the uploaded without need to switch to none-ISP mode.

### lpc21isp

Fast ISP upload tool for LPC804, Windows and Linux. Automatic execution seems to be broken, so a manual 
start of the code is required by putting the target device into none-ISP mode.

### pluc

Sourcecode and binaries for the PLU compiler written for this project.
