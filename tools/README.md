### hex2lpc8xx

A small and reliable ISP upload tool for the LPC804. Linux only. 

 - Upload tool for LPC8xx hex files (intel hex format)
 - UART upload interface
 - NXP LPC checksum calculation
 - Autostart feature (Can execute the uploaded without need to switch to none-ISP mode)

### lpc21isp

Fast ISP upload tool for LPC804, Windows and Linux. Manual 
start of the code is required by putting the target device into none-ISP mode.

A comparison between lpc21isp and hex2lpc8xx is [here](https://drolliblog.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/isp-upload-for-the-nxp-lpc804/).

### pluc

"pluc" is the PLU Compiler tool, developed as part of this project. 
It is derived from my older project DGC and is based as much as possible 
on the DGC sources.

"pluc" is a synthesis compiler, which creates a C-function. This C-function
includes all the setup code required for the LPC804 PLU.

"pluc" accepts boolean expressions (PLA, BEX) and state machines (KISS, BMS) as
input. 
 
"pluc" vs NXP "PLU configuration tool":
 - pluc is just a commandline tool, it reads a specification and writes C code
 - pluc basically does not require any knowledge of the PLU details, just specify the problem. "pluc" will generate an error if the result does not fit into the PLU.
 - pluc is available for linux and windows
 - pluc does not support high level languages like VHDL or Verilog. However the asumption is, that PLA, BEX, KISS or BMS formats are powerful enough to describe problems for the LPC804 PLU.
 - pluc does not contain a graphical user interface or schematic editor
 - Algorithms inside pluc (dgc) and NXP "PLU configuration tool" (SIS) are both based on the research happend between 1980 and 1990.
